# Dotfiles

My dotfiles used on Arch Linux and OSX. Highlights:

* Configuration for Vim, Emacs and Xmonad
* Utility scripts in `./shell`

## Install

Prerequisites: zsh

`./shell/install-lsund-base` installs my base packages (with sudo)
`./shell/install-symlinks` links each configuration file in directory ~/Documents/dotfiles to ~
